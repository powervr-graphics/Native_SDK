		<h2>Android</h2>
			<p>The PowerVR Graphics SDK examples have been redesigned with the aim of making it as easy as possible to use with the new Android tools, including moving from Apache Ant to Gradle, and from Eclipse to Android Studio.</p>
			<p>Using Gradle scripts, the native (NDK) component has been integrated with the Android Java component, so as to allow easier building from the Command Line (using the Gradle wrapper), or from Android Studio.</p>
			<p>The following instructions for building the examples in the Android PowerVR Graphics SDK assume that you have:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Installed the Android SDK from Google</li>
				<li>Installed the Android NDK</li>
				<li>Added the Android NDK to the system path</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Adding the Android NDK to the system path for Windows has changed to <span class="code">Control Panel/System/Advanced System Settings/Advanced/Environment Variables</span>. On Linux it is dependent on the specific system. It is also recommended to add the <span class="code"><abbr title="Path to the Android PowerVR Graphics SDK.">[Android SDK]</abbr>/platform-tools</span> sub-directory to the path to facilitate <span class="code">adb</span> and similar tools.</p>
			<p>It is recommended to build through Android Studio, but it is also possible to build through a Command Line.</p>
			<p><strong>To build through the Android Studio:</strong></p>
			<ol>
				<li>On the Startup screen or in the main Android Studio screen, select <span class="code">Import Project</span></li>
				<li>Navigate to the <span class="code">/Build/Android</span> sub-directory of the component to build</li>
				<li>Select the <span class="code">build.gradle</span> file (will normally have a green icon) and press <span class="code">OK</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>From that point onwards, the project can be debugged and/or built using Android Studio as normal.</p>
			<p><strong>To build through the Command Line:</strong></p>
			<ol>
				<li>A file named <span class="code">local.properties</span> must be present in the <span class="code">/Build/Android</span> sub-directory. This file must contain a line pointing to the Android SDK. On Windows, bear in mind that backslashes (<span class="code">\</span>) must be escaped (<span class="code">\\</span>), and semicolons (<span class="code">:</span>) must be escaped (<span class="code">\:</span>) as well. For example:
				<ul>
					<br>
					<li>Windows: <span class="code">sdk.dir=C\:\\Android\\AndroidSdk</span></li>
					<li>Linux: <span class="code">sdk.dir=/usr/local/android_sdk</span></li>
				</ul>
				<p>In order to create this file you can open a new file in any suitable text editor, like Notepad on Windows or Vim, Sublime etc. on Linux.</p>
				<p>If you have imported the example in Android Studio, the <span class="code">local.properties</span> file will have already been created for you.</p>
				</li>
				<li>Run Gradle. We are bundling the Gradle wrapper so the required Gradle version will automatically be downloaded and used. On Windows, run <span class="code">gradlew [target]</span>; on Linux, run <span class="code">./gradlew [target]</span>, where <span class="code">[target]</span> is usually:
				<ul>
					<br>
					<li><span class="code">clean</span> to remove old build and temporary files</li>
					<li><span class="code">assembleDebug</span> to create a debug version of the application</li>
					<li><span class="code">assembleRelease</span> to create the basis for a release version of the application. In order to create a release version of your application, visit the page <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/index.html" target="_blank">http://developer.android.com/guide/index.html</a></li>
				</ul>

		<div id="ios">
		<h2>iOS</h2>
			<p>To proceed with the installation of the PowerVR Graphics SDK on iOS, complete the following steps:<p>
			<ol>
				<li>
				<p>Download a version of Apple's iOS SDK from <a href="http://developer.apple.com/ios/" target="_blank">http://developer.apple.com/ios/</a>. You will need to become a member of Apple's developer programme in order to access this page. You can find details of how to join at <a href="http://developer.apple.com" target="_blank">http://developer.apple.com</a>.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>Install the Apple SDK on your Mac as specified by Apple's hardware and software requirements. This should also install Xcode and the other development tools required.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>Expand the PowerVR Graphics SDK for iOS to a location for which you have both read and write access.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>To build the examples and other projects from the SDK, find the various <span class="code"><abbr title=" Shorthand for the targeted Application Programming Interface.">[API]</abbr>***.xcode</span> projects available within the <span class="code">SDKPackage_<abbr title=" Shorthand for the targeted Application Programming Interface.">[API]</abbr></span> directory and double click these to launch them in Xcode.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>To build for an iOS device you will need a valid developer certificate in your machine's keychain. You may also have to change the <span class="code">Properties | Identifier</span> property from <span class="code">Project | Edit Active Target...</span> to match that which you have set up for yourself through Apple's Program Portal.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>If you do not have a developer certificate from Apple then you can still build and launch applications in the iOS Simulator. Choose this configuration from the dropdown menu at the top left and then choose <span class="code">Build and Run</span> from the dropdown menu.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> The Scheme that you are building under may need to be set up for the SDK's projects to run.</em></p>
		</div>
		
		<div id="windows">
		<h2>Windows</h2>
			<p>This SDK requires a PC equipped with Windows XP, Windows Vista or Windows 7. The required installation steps are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
				<p>Install the SDK on your machine as specified by Windows hardware and software requirements. The project and solution files provided do not require the SDK to be installed in a pre-defined location and are configured to use relative paths.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>If you have installed our SDK with the installer, the PVRVFrame libraries will already be in your PATH environment variable.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> The examples can be launched directly from their project files.</em></p>
			<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> If the installer has not added the PVRVFrame directory to your PATH environment variable, you must copy the PVRVFrame emulation "drivers" to a DLL-accessible directory prior to running the SDK applications. The driver files names are; EGL, GLES_CM (OpenGL ES 1.x) and GLESv2 (OpenGL ES 2.0 & 3.x). The PVRVFrame libraries are provided as static libraries (lib*.lib) and dynamic libraries (lib*.dll).</em></p>
		</div>
		
		<div id="osx">
		<h2>OS X</h2>	
			<p>The OS X SDK requires OS X (Snow Leopard) or higher for full operation.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
				<p>Install the latest version of Xcode, available from <a href="http://developer.apple.com/" target="_blank">http://developer.apple.com/</a> or from the Mac App store.</p>
				<li>
				<p>Expand the PowerVR Graphics SDK for OS X into a location for which you have full access.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>To build the examples and other projects from the SDK, find the various <span class="code"><abbr title=" Shorthand for the targeted Application Programming Interface.">[API]</abbr>***.xcodeproj</span> projects available within the <span class="code">SDKPackage_<abbr title=" Shorthand for the targeted Application Programming Interface.">[API]</abbr></span> directory and double click these to launch them in Xcode.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> The Scheme that you are building under may need to be set up for the SDK's projects to run.</em></p>
		</div>
		
		<div id="linux">
		<h2>Linux</h2>
			<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> API libraries are not distributed with the PowerVR Graphics SDK for Linux. Please ask your platform provider for these libraries if you do not have them. You will also need to install the latest platform toolchain on your development machine for your target platform.</em></p>
			<p>To build the code examples, follow the steps below:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
				<p>Define the <span class="code">TOOLCHAIN</span> environment variable to the toolchain directory, or add the path of the toolchain to the <span class="code">PATH</span> environment variable (i.e., run <span class="code">export PATH="<i>path to the toolchain</i>:$PATH"</span>).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>If you want an X11 build and it is available, define the environment variable <span class="code">X11ROOT</span> to point to the <span class="code">freedesktop</span> directory (i.e., <span class="code">export X11ROOT=/usr/X11R6_SGX</span>).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>To build individual components go to the directory <span class="code">Examples/<abbr title="The name of the folder the examples are sorted into according to their complexity.">[ExampleLevel]</abbr>/<abbr title="The name of the example application that you are building.">[ExampleName]</abbr>/<abbr title=" Shorthand for the targeted Application Programming Interface.">[API]</abbr>/Build/LinuxGeneric</span> and run the command: <span class="code">LinuxNullWS: "make PLATFORM=<abbr title="The targeted Application Binary Interface.">[Platform]</abbr>"</span> or <span class="code">LinuxX11: "make PLATFORM=<abbr title="The targeted Application Binary Interface.">[Platform]</abbr> X11BUILD=1"</span>. <span class="code"><abbr title="The targeted Application Binary Interface.">[Platform]</abbr></span> is an entry from one of the following supported ABIs:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>armv7</li>
						<li>armv7hf</li>
						<li>armv8</li>
						<li>mips_32</li>
						<li>mips_64</li>
						<li>x86_32</li>
						<li>x86_64</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
				<p>The executables for the examples will be under:	<span class="code">Examples/<abbr title="The name of the folder the examples are sorted into according to their complexity.">[ExampleLevel]</abbr>/<abbr title="The name of the example application that you are building.">[ExampleName]</abbr>/<abbr title=" Shorthand for the targeted Application Programming Interface.">[API]</abbr>/Build/<abbr title="The targeted Application Binary Interface.">[Platform]</abbr>/<abbr title="This refers to the release directory.">[ReleaseDir]</abbr></span> where <span class="code"><abbr title="This refers to the release directory.">[ReleaseDir]</abbr></span> is one of <span class="code">ReleaseNullWS</span> or <span class="code">ReleaseX11</span></p>
			<p>To run an executable, follow the steps below:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
				<p>Ensure that the PowerVR drivers are installed on the target device (please refer to the DDK/driver installation instructions).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>If the standard C++ libraries are not present on your target device, copy <span class="code">libc++</span> from the toolchain into <span class="code">/usr/lib</span>. <span class="code">libdl</span> and <span class="code">libgcc</span> may also be required.</p>
				<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> <span class="code">libc++</span> lives at <span class="code">/usr/lib</span> if you have installed the drivers, or can be found as part of a binary driver release package.</em></p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>Ensure the drivers are running (e.g., type <span class="code">/etc/init.d/rc/pvr</span> start, then run an X session if required).</p>
				<p>Under X11, window sizes can be specified for the executables using the command-line arguments <span class="code">-posx=n</span> and <span class="code">-posy=n</span> to define the top right hand corner, and <span class="code">-width=n</span> and <span class="code">-height=n</span> to define width and height, respectively.</p>
				<p>For example:</p>
				<p class="code">./<abbr title=" Shorthand for the targeted Application Programming Interface.">[API]</abbr>IntroducingPOD -posx=10 -posy=10 -width=100 -height=100</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>If you attempt to run an SDK example and it fails with the message: <span class="code">"Can't open display"</span> produced by the X client, then make sure that the <span class="code">DISPLAY</span> variable is set with the shell command: <span class='code'>"set | grep -e DISPLAY"</span>. If this command does not yield any output then type (in shell): <span class='code'>"DISPLAY=:0.0; export DISPLAY"</span></p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<div id="webgl">
		<h2>WebGL</h2>	
			<p>The steps below highlight the procedure for setting up the WebGL SDK:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
				<p>To host and run the WebGL SDK you will need a web server. Since the WebGL SDK only uses HTML5 and JavaScript (no dynamically generated content) any web server capable of serving HTML is suitable for hosting it. The WebGL SDK does not require building.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>To use the WebGL SDK, copy across the contents of the WebGL package to an appropriate location in your web server tree (in some cases, also configure your web server to serve it), keeping the folder structure intact.</p> 
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>You can then navigate to and launch the required example from the SDK Browser.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> If you do not have a web server available, you will need to install and configure one, as appropriate. For example, on Windows, IIS is usually built in and may require to be enabled and configured. On OS X, Apache may require to be enabled and configured. Most Linux distributions will contain a web server such as Apache. Alternatively, you may want to download, install and configure another web server depending on what your specific needs are. A useful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_server_software" target="_blank">comparison of web server software</a> is available in Wikipedia.</em></p>
