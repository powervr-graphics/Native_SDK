\section overview Overview
*****************************
PVRVK is a library providing an advanced interface that is close enough to the original Vulkan interface
to be perfectly useable with the Vulkan spec, while offering a sweet spot combination of simplicity,
ease of use and minimal overhead. Its most important features are C++ language offering defaults and
constructors for all objects, deterministic lifecycle management through reference counting and in
general a clean, modern interface.
