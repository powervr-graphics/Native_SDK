A Node has its own parenting, material, animation and custom user data. The tree&#45;structure assumes transformational hierarchy (as usual), so parent transformations should be applied to children. Transformations are expressed through Animation objects (a static transform is an animation with a single frame). Note: Node ID and MeshID can sometimes be confusing: They will always be the same (when a MeshID makes sense) because Meshes are always laid out first in the internal list of Nodes." alt="" coords="5,5,145,47"/>
