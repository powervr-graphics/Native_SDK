PostProcessing

:ShortDescription:
This training course demonstrates a simple implementation of a 'bloom' post processing effect.

:FullDescription:
This training course demonstrates a simple implementation of a 'bloom' post processing effect, using Render Passes (Vulkan)/ Render To Texture (OpenGL ES)
to render an intermediate scene and use it for postprocessing. The bright parts of the picture are extracted in lower resolution in a post processing step,
blurred and then added over the final image to create a glow around the object's borders.

:APIS:
Vulkan , OpenGL ES 2.0+

:Controls:
	-	Left/Right	-	Change the rendering mode (Object with bloom, object w/o bloom, bloom textures)
	-	Up/Down	-	Increase/Decrease bloom intensity
	-	Any Action	-	Pause
	-	Quit	-	Close the application
