:ShortDescription:
Demonstrates dynamic reflection and refraction using a dual paraboloid environment map.

:FullDescription:
This example shows a technique to maintain a dynamic environment map by rendering both hemispheres of the scene to two halves of a single rectangular texture. In addition, this also demonstrates rendering skyboxes with a full screen quad, reflection and refraction with chromatic dispersion.
