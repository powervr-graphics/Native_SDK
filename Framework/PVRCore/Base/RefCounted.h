	/// <remarks>WARNING. This function does NOT cause lifetime dependencies, it only EXPRESSES them if they already exist.
	/// i.e. The main purpose of this method is to allow the user to express hierarchical lifetime relationships
	/// between objects. For example, if we had a RefCountedResource<std::vector<pvr::assets::Model>> (that is never
	/// modified), this method would allow us to get smart resources to the Mesh objects of the models, with shared
	/// refcounting to the vector object, and not keep the original RefCountedResource at all, allowing the vector to
	/// be destroyed automatically when no references to its Meshes exist anymore - the Meshes would all be destroyed
	/// together as normal when the vector was destroyed, in turn deleting the Models, in turn deleting the Meshes.
	/// WARNING: All that this method does is make sure that as long as pointers to children exist, the parent object
	/// stays alive. If the parent objects are in fact unrelated (For example, have a Mesh share refcounting to a
	/// std::vector<Mesh> that does NOT contain it, then a) The object will not be properly destroyed when its
	/// reference is released, and b1) Potentially result in a memory leak if the object actually needed to be
	/// released an/or b2) Cause undefined behaviour when the object was released by its "normal" lifetime, since the
	/// shared resource was NOT really keeping it alive.</remarks>
