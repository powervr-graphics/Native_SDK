Description
-----------
This example shows basic use of the PVRVk library. PVRVk provides an advanced interface similar to the original Vulkan interface, making it useable with the Vulkan specification. It offers a sweet spot combination of simplicity, ease of use, with minimal overhead. 

The most important features of PVRVk are considered to be:

* C++ language, offering defaults and constructors for all objects 
* deterministic lifecycle management through reference counting
* a clean, modern interface.
